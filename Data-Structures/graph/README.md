# Hashtables

## Challenge
Implement a graph as an adjacency list.


## Approach & Efficiency
The Graph object is composed of Vertex and Edge objects.

Vertex objects hold the value and they are stored in a map with a key-value setting that represents Vertex-Array of Edges

Edge objects contain the 2nd Vertex Reference as well as the associated weight (if any - this will default to zero)
